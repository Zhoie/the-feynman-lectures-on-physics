# Evaporation, Condensation, and Dissolution

This lab shows a two-phase box with **liquid** below and **gas** above. Particles
can evaporate into the gas or condense back into the liquid, forming a dynamic
equilibrium. A separate salt lattice dissolves faster as temperature rises.

## What you can do
- Raise **temperature** to increase evaporation and dissolution.
- Increase **humidity** to load the gas phase and boost condensation.
- Increase **salt concentration** to slow dissolution.

## What to notice
- Evaporation and condensation rates settle into a balance.
- More humidity shifts the net flux toward condensation.
- Dissolution is faster at higher temperature.
