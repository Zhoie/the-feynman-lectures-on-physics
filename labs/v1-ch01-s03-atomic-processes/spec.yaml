title: Evaporation, Condensation, and Dissolution
chapter: "1 Atoms in Motion"
section: "1-3 Atomic processes"
archetype: phase-exchange
summary: >
  Particles exchange between liquid and gas with competing evaporation and
  condensation fluxes. A salt lattice dissolves faster as temperature rises.
