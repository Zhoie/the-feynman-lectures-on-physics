# Isolated Collisions and the Center of Mass

Two carts collide on a track. With no external force, the **total momentum**
stays constant and the **center of mass** moves steadily.

## What you can do
- Change the **masses** and **initial velocities**.
- Adjust the **restitution** to make collisions elastic or inelastic.
- Apply a constant **external force** to cart 1.

## What to notice
- When external force is zero, momentum barely drifts.
- The center of mass moves at a constant speed in the isolated case.
- With an external force, the momentum curve bends.
