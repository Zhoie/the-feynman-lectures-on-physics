# Barrier Crossing and Reaction Rate

This lab treats a chemical reaction as **motion over an energy barrier**.
Particles wander in a double-well potential. When they cross from one side to
the other, we count a reaction event.

## What you can do
- Raise **temperature** to increase thermal fluctuations.
- Increase **barrier height** to make crossings rarer.
- Toggle the **catalyst** to lower the effective barrier.

## What to notice
- Higher temperature produces more crossings per unit time.
- Lowering the barrier (catalyst on) boosts the crossing rate.
