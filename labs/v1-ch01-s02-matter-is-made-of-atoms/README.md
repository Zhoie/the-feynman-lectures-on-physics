# Atoms, Phases, and Brownian Motion

This lab uses a simple Lennard-Jones style particle box. The same microscopic
rules generate **solid-like**, **liquid-like**, and **gas-like** behavior as
you vary temperature and density. A heavy tracer particle demonstrates
Brownian motion.

## What you can do
- Increase **temperature** to loosen the structure and speed up particles.
- Increase **density** to pack atoms more tightly.
- Adjust **drag** to damp or amplify thermal agitation.

## What to notice
- Low temperature + high density looks lattice-like (solid).
- Moderate temperature gives flowing, locally ordered motion (liquid).
- High temperature produces free-flight collisions (gas).
- The tracer’s mean squared displacement grows over time.
