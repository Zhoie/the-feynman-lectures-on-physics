# Equal-Mass Recoil

Two identical carts start at rest, then recoil with equal and opposite momentum.
They bounce off the walls and return to rest at the center. The **total
momentum stays near zero** throughout.

## What you can do
- Change the **cart mass** and **release energy**.

## What to notice
- The center-of-mass marker stays fixed while the carts fly apart.
- Momentum arrows show p1 and p2 pointing in opposite directions; p total stays near zero.
- The momentum chart shows p1 and p2 equal and opposite, while p total stays near zero.
- Higher energy gives larger speeds but still cancels momentum.
