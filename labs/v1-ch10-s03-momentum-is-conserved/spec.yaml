title: Equal-Mass Recoil
chapter: "10 Conservation of Momentum"
section: "10-3 Momentum is conserved!"
archetype: explosion
summary: >
  Two equal carts start at rest and recoil with opposite momentum. They bounce
  off the walls and return to rest at the center while total momentum stays
  near zero.
