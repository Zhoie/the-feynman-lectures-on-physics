# Classical vs Relativistic Momentum

This lab compares the classical momentum formula `p = mv` with the relativistic
expression `p = gamma mv`. At low speeds they are nearly identical, but at high
speeds the classical formula fails.

## What you can do
- Set **v max** to expand the velocity range.
- Move the **probe velocity** to read off the two momentum values.
- Change the **mass** to scale the curves.

## What to notice
- At low speed the relative error is tiny.
- Near light speed the relativistic momentum grows much faster.
