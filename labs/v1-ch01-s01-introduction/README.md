# From Data to a Law

This lab models the idea that **laws are tested by experiments and only hold
within a valid range**. The data are generated from a relativistic mass model,
then you fit either a constant-mass law or a relativistic law and compare
residuals.

## What you can do
- Increase **v max** to push the data into relativistic speeds.
- Add **measurement noise** to see how uncertainty affects the fit.
- Switch the **model** between constant mass and relativistic mass.

## What to notice
- At low speeds the constant-mass model fits well.
- At high speeds the constant-mass residuals grow quickly.
- The relativistic model keeps errors small across the full range.
