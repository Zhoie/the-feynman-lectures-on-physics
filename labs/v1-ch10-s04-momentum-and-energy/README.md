# Momentum Conserved, Energy Not Always

Two carts collide on a track. Momentum is conserved for the system, but kinetic
energy can drop when the collision is inelastic.

## What you can do
- Change **masses** and **initial velocities**.
- Adjust **restitution** to control energy loss.

## What to notice
- Total momentum stays nearly constant.
- When restitution is less than 1, the energy ratio `K/K0` decreases.
