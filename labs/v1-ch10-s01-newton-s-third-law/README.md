# Action and Reaction

Two carts are connected by a spring. Force sensors on each cart show that the
forces are always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

## What you can do
- Change the **mass of cart 2** (cart 1 stays at 1 unit).
- Set the **initial spring stretch** to control the force size.

## What to notice
- `F12` and `F21` mirror each other at all times.
- The sum `F12 + F21` stays near zero.
